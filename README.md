# Sabergrill Bakeshop Website
Food ordering website that allows users to do takeout for school culinary sales.
Kids ordering at our school's culinary sales service during certain times can be chaotic. The line will be too long, the service will take too much time, once something sells out they have to repeat the same thing to buyers, and people will also cut in front of each other. My solution is an website to preorder things similarly to a takeout system at restaurants. This will allow buyers to know how much of something is in stock, what time they will come in to pick up their order, how much the sellers should organize for the order, and an extra payment option to purchase the products online rather than just cash.
